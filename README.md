# MakeMeHostNotifier
Just a simple script that notifies whether or not there is a game with the specified name.
I repeat: it is really really simple, I hardcoded 'PARASITE' and 'P A R A S I T E' game names, but you can edit them or add more entries if you want other type of games.

It will work checking the site every minute, and sending a small notification on the low right corner if the game appears. It will tell you every time it checks, with timestamp. The message will be 'down' if there is no game.
It will become 'up' with the game name and number of players if a game appears.
The .bat file is there to quickstart the python script from the desktop.

I made this yesterday (21/06/2015) so it might have bugs.

Enjoy and play more parasite.
