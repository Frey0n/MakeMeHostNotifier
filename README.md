# MakeMeHostNotifier
Just a simple script that notifies whether or not there is a game with the specified name.
I repeat: it is really really simple, I hardcoded 'PARASITE' and 'P A R A S I T E' game names, but you can edit them or add more entries if you want other type of games.

It will work checking the site every minute, and sending a little baloon notification on the low right corner if the game appears. It will tell you every time it checks, with timestamp. The message will change from 'down' to 'up' if the game appears.
I made this yesterday (21/06/2015) so it might have bugs.

Enjoy and play more parasite.
